# The Case for Whimsy

### React Europe 2018 talk by Josh Comeau

This repository contains the slides and related code for my React Europe 2018 talk.

Sadly, it's a bit disorganized (I thought I'd have time to organize everything, but then suddenly it was the conference ðŸ˜¨). This README aims to help you navigate, to explore all the ideas I shared in my talk.

#### Recording

#### Slides

* [Original](https://the-case-for-whimsy.surge.sh)
* [With presenter notes](http://the-case-for-whimsy.surge.sh/#/0?presenter&) (there aren't many, but hopefully they help!)

This repo also holds the code for all the slides. It's super messy, but the presentation mostly lives in [src/presentation.js](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/blob/master/src/presentation.js).

You can also check out the components used for the live examples in [src/components](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/tree/master/src/components). Some highlights:

* [WibblyWobblyCircle](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/blob/master/src/components/WibblyWobblyCircle/WibblyWobblyCircle.js) - A floating, warbly circle.
* [TitleParticles](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/tree/master/src/components/TitleParticles) - A few slides in, I introduce the talk. The intro slide has these floating self-drawing particle things, described by the components in this directory.
* [FoldConcept](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/blob/master/src/components/FoldConcept/FoldConcept.js) - While the actual `<Foldable />` component is described below under **Whimsical Mail Client**, this is the code for the concept fold. Might be easier to follow, although you almost definitely want to use the `<Foldable />` code below for your own apps.

#### Confetti

The talk features a confetti rain.

For the demo, [play with it here](http://the-case-for-whimsy.surge.sh/#/16).

For the code, it lives in this repo. Here are some links:

* [Canvas](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/blob/master/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.js) - The generic, reusable HTML canvas primitive component.
* [Confetti](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/blob/master/src/components/Confetti/Confetti.js)
* [ConfettiManager](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/blob/master/src/components/ConfettiManager/ConfettiManager.js) - This is the code for managing the [demo](http://the-case-for-whimsy.surge.sh/#/16), to tweak the parameters.

Additionally, the live-editable examples can be found [here](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/tree/master/src/code).

#### Whimsical Mail Client

The talk also featuers a fictitious email client.

You can [play with the demo](https://whimsical-mail-client.surge.sh)

> **Please note**: the code is not production-ready. This is not a real application, and it hasn't been thoroughly tested. There may be bugs if you deviate from the happy-path stuff done in the talk.
>
> As for the components, they're messier than the ones in the talk, and not very well commented. If you have any questions, please do reach out to me [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/joshwcomeau).

The code for that project lives in a [separate repo](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client), and the code is split among a number of different files:

* [NodeProvider](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/NodeProvider/NodeProvider.js) - a context-driven helper to capture and use references to DOM nodes.
* [Foldable](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/Foldable/Foldable.js) - A behavioural component that lets you tri-fold its children like a letter.
* [Transport](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/Transport/Transport.js) - A behavioural component that moves its children between specified DOM nodes, based on a provided status.
* [ComposeEmailContainer](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/ComposeEmailContainer/ComposeEmailContainer.js) - The container for the "compose email" modal. Uses `Foldable` and `Transport` to do the neat animations.
* [EtchASketchShaker](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/EtchASketchShaker/EtchASketchShaker.js) - The cute shake-to-clear animation used when clicking "clear".
* [Scoocher](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/Scoocher/Scoocher.js) - I didn't really mention this in the talk, but there's a fun little underline for the top-left navigation tabs that "scooches" around to indicate the selected tab.
* [NotificationDot](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/whimsical-mail-client/blob/master/src/components/NotificationDot/NotificationDot.js) - Also not mentioned, but there's a cute little indicator dot for tabs with unread messages.

I took inspiration from Tobias Ahlin's fantastic blog post on [Meaningful Motion with Action-Driven Animation](http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/meaningful-motion-w-action-driven-animation/). Highly-recommended reading.

#### Accessibility

Whimsical touches are great fun, and are valuable to the user experience, but they aren't critical. Making sure your site works for folks with disabilities is a far greater priority.

For learning about accessibility, I'd recommend Google's [Web Fundamentals course](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/).

Some additional resources:

* [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/) - A community-driven effort to make web accessibility easier.
* [`prefers-reduced-motion` media query](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/)
* [w3 guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)

#### Other Cool Things

My talk mentions WebRender, Firefox's new rendering engine. Lin Clark has a [wonderful intro article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/) on the subject.

Another really exciting thing coming up is Houdini, a collection of CSS innovations. Read more about [CSS Paint](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/paintapi) and [CSS Layout](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/05/houdini#layout_worklet).
